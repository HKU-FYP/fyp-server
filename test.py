   'excerpt': 'Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos joined Samsung in a $700 million bet on Tenstorrent, valuing the AI chip startup with ambitions of taking on Nvidia Corp. at about $2.6 billion.',
   'summary': "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos joined Samsung in a $700 million bet on Tenstorrent, valuing the AI chip startup with ambitions of taking on Nvidia Corp. at about $2.6 billion.\nTenstorrent, which hopes to create a chip to try and break Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI business, raised capital in a funding round led by South Korea's AFW Partners and Samsung Securities, founder and semiconductor pioneer Jim Keller said in an interview. Bezos Expeditions joined LG Electronics Inc. and Fidelity in that financing, betting on Keller's pedigree and the booming opportunity in artificial intelligence tech.\nThe money will be used to build out Tenstorrent's engineering team, invest in its global supply chain and build large artificial intelligence training servers to help demonstrate its technology.\nAs the quest for more power and cost efficiency in AI ramps up, smaller companies are sprouting up trying to snatch market share from Nvidia's power-hungry chips. Tenstorrent, an Nvidia neighbor in Santa Clara, California, is one of many now engineering solutions aimed at delivering a more affordable path to AI development. That's built on open-source and commonplace technology, avoiding complex and pricey components like the high-bandwidth memory Nvidia favors.\n'You can't beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,' Keller said. 'But they'll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.'\nNvidia offers developers a full suite of proprietary technology, covering everything from the chips to the interconnects and even data center layouts, with the promise of all parts working better because they were designed in concert. Companies like rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Tenstorrent are instead aiming for greater interoperability with other technology providers, whether through shared industry standards or opening their designs for others to use.\nTenstorrent is also a proponent of an alternative kind of logic processor based on an open standard called RISC-V, which poses a challenge to Arm Holdings Plc. Keller, known for his silicon design work at Apple Inc., Tesla Inc. and AMD, is an advocate.\n'In the past, I worked with proprietary tech and it was really tough,' Keller said. 'Open source helps you build a bigger platform. It attracts engineers. And yes, it's a little bit of a passion project.'\nMuch like RISC-V and Japanese partner Rapidus Corp., Tenstorrent still has a lot to prove. To date, the nascent company has signed contracts with customers totaling nearly $150 million, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's tens of billions of dollars of datacenter revenue each quarter.\nTenstorrent plans to release a new AI processor at a cadence of every two years, Keller said. Nvidia, on the other hand, intends to refresh its AI chip offerings on an annual cycle, its boss Jensen Huang said in June.\nAFW Partners invested after hearing positive feedback from Korean companies already collaborating with Tenstorrent, such as LG, said managing director Bonil Koo.\nTenstorrent's first chips were made by GlobalFoundries Inc., and the next iterations will come from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., the company said. It's begun designing for cutting-edge 2-nanometer fabrication as well. TSMC and Samsung will commence their mass production at that scale next year, and Tenstorrent is in discussions with them and Japan's Rapidus, which aims for 2nm output in 2027.\nOther investors in this funding round include Export Development Canada, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Hyundai Motor Group and Baillie Gifford.\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

   'summary': "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.'s founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang agreed to open an artificial intelligence research and development center in Vietnam as the company steps up its presence in Southeast Asia.\nThe project, along with a Viettel Group data center that uses Nvidia technology, will help develop advanced AI in the country, Vietnam's Investment Minister Nguyen Chi Dung said at a signing ceremony in Hanoi on Thursday. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh was also in attendance.\n'Nvidia will advance Vietnam's AI by building AI infrastructure, growing the number of AI experts in Vietnam and supporting AI startups,' Huang said at a briefing with Dung.\nNvidia will also acquire Vingroup JSC's AI unit VinBrain, which is 'the starting point of a major future design center,' Huang said. VinBrain is a startup whose focus includes applying AI to the medical field, according to its website. Huang did not give a valuation for the VinBrain acquisition. Vingroup representatives were not immediately available for comment outside normal business hours.\n'Today is the birthday of Nvidia Vietnam.' Huang added.\nBefore coming to Hanoi, Huang met with Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday and agreed to strengthen cooperation with the country, including help in developing the country's AI infrastructure.\nThe Nvidia chief executive officer's regional tour comes as Southeast Asian countries compete for big tech investments to become data center and AI hubs. Damac Group, backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, plans to invest about $3 billion to build data centers in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand over the next three to five years.\n'Nvidia's support in the AI field will help Vietnam not only achieve its development goals in high-tech industry in general and AI \u200b\u200bfield in particular, but also contribute to boosting the entire Southeast Asia region to become a destination of innovation,' Dung said.\nLast year, Huang told Chinh that Nvidia was eyeing a semiconductor center in Vietnam after investing about $250 million in the nation. In April, the Vietnamese government said Nvidia was reviewing three Vietnam cities — Ho Chi Minh City, Danang and Hanoi — for an AI center.\nVietnam is targeting annual revenue of more than $100 billion from the semiconductor industry by 2050. The government aims to set up three big data centers and three AI centers by 2030, according to a national strategy released in 2021.\n'A country's data should be considered its natural and national resource,' Huang said. 'Vietnam should process your own data and transform it into Vietnam AI for your industry and society.'\n--With assistance from Linh Vu Nguyen.\n(Updates with VinBrain details and extra quotes.)\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

  'clean_url': 'forbes.com',
  'excerpt': "Smith's report on the 2020 election case was made public shortly after midnight on Tuesday after Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon allowed its release.",
  'summary': "Federal investigators had gathered sufficient evidence to convict President-elect Donald Trump had he not won the elections in November, former Special Counsel Jack Smith wrote in his final report on his investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as Attorney General Merrick Garland made the report's first volume public early on Tuesday after Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon rejected a last-minute bid by the President-elect to block it.\nIn the report, Smith wrote 'but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency,' his office assessed that 'the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.'\nThe case was dropped as the Constitution prohibits the indictment and prosecution of a sitting president, but Smith said in the report that this 'does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution,' which his office 'stands fully behind.'\nThe Justice Department released the first volume of Smith's final report Tuesday, which covers Smith's now-dismissed criminal case into Trump and his allies' wide-ranging efforts to overturn the 2020 election, making the document public following a court battle to keep it hidden.\nThe volume is one of two in Smith's final report—the other covers the investigation into Trump allegedly withholding White House documents—but is the only one that was expected to be released, as Garland has said he doesn't want the volume on the documents case to be released publicly while Trump's co-defendants in the case are still being prosecuted.\nThis is a developing story.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text 'Alerts' to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in the 2020 election case and has denied any wrongdoing. The president-elect and his lawyers strongly opposed Smith's report being made public, filing briefs in court arguing for it to be blocked and sending a letter to Garland asking him to keep the document hidden. 'The report is nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power,' Trump's attorneys wrote in a recent court filing. Trump's co-defendants in the documents case, aides Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, also requested the entire report not be released—including the section on the election case—claiming in court filings they feared even the election volume could hurt their prosecution if there were any mentions of the documents case.\nGarland has so far refused to release the volume of the report on the documents case while the prosecution against Nauta and de Oliveira remains ongoing, though he is trying to make the report available for select members of Congress to view privately. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, is still weighing that request, only letting the election-related volume of Smith's report be released in an order Monday while she deliberates on the documents volume. A hearing is scheduled to take place Friday over whether that volume of the report can be released, unless the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overturns Cannon's ruling before then and allows prosecutors to show select lawmakers the details on the documents case. Garland's refusal to release the report while Nauta and de Oliveira still face prosecution makes it unlikely the report will ever be released to the public, however. It's expected the prosecution against Trump's co-defendants won't end until after Trump takes office, at which point it would be up to Pam Bondi, his attorney general pick, to decide whether the report should be released—which she's unlikely to do, given the report criticizes Trump.\nSenate Democrats are pushing Garland to preserve all the evidence from Smith's investigations into Trump, given the possibility the incoming Trump administration could bury the information over its criticism of the president-elect. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office is prosecuting a number of Trump's allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has also asked the DOJ to turn over the entire case file from Smith's 2020 election case in order to help the state's ongoing litigation, renewing the request in a letter Monday after previous requests for Smith's information were previously rejected while the government's prosecution was still ongoing. 'Undoubtedly, disclosing Special Counsel's file to my office will help ensure that those who should be held accountable are,' Mayes wrote, adding that she also 'must be sure the rights of the defendants are protected as well' and 'welcome[s] any exculpatory material that the Special Counsel possesses.'\nWhile the Justice Department's criminal case against Trump was dismissed following his election, multiple states still have pending criminal charges against people involved with the post-election plot. Arizona has brought criminal charges against such Trump allies as ex-attorney Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn, and that case is anticipated to go to trial in January 2026. Prosecutors in Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada have also brought criminal charges against Trump allies involved with the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, primarily GOP officials who signed off on slates of electors in the battleground states that falsely claimed Trump had won. Criminal charges are still pending against Trump and allies including Giuliani and Meadows in Georgia, but the fate of that case is now up in the air after a Georgia appeals court ruled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from overseeing the prosecution. Willis has appealed that ruling, but if it stands, it's unclear how long it could take for another prosecutor to take over the case, or if the litigation could be dropped entirely. Trump has asked to have the charges against him dropped in the Georgia case, which the court didn't rule on prior to Willis' disqualification, but the case would still proceed against his co-defendants even if Trump gets dismissed from the case.\nGarland appointed Smith in 2022 as special counsel to oversee the government's investigations against Trump, with Smith ultimately bringing two of the four total criminal cases that Trump faced prior to his election. Neither federal case went to trial, as Trump was ultimately able to delay both of them until after the election, and Smith dismissed the cases after Trump's victory, citing the Justice Department's policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Smith filed his report with the Justice Department last week before resigning Friday, in line with federal rules requiring special counsels to 'provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining' their prosecutorial decisions. It is then up to the attorney general to decide whether the report should be released publicly. The report came under fire in court last week, after Nauta and de Oliveira asked Cannon to block the document from being released. Cannon temporarily blocked the report until the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals could rule on it, which the appeals court did Thursday, ruling the report should be released but keeping Cannon's order in place. Cannon's order said the report could not be released until three days after the 11th Circuit's ruling, and while Nauta and de Oliveira asked for her to further extend the delay on releasing the report, she ultimately ruled against them Monday, at least for the volume covering the election case. That meant her order expired at midnight EST on Monday, clearing the way for the DOJ to release the report. While the case never went to trial, Smith's final report on the election case also comes after the special counsel released a thorough document in October outlining the government's case against Trump, as Smith tried to keep the case afloat following the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump some immunity from criminal prosecution.\nWill Jack Smith's Final Trump Report Be Released This Week?

So I'll post out sourced articles very soon on Mathys Tel, Christopher Nkunku, and two other players!!\nChelsea play football again tonight and this time we have a slightly more difficult opponent to face than Morecambe on Saturday.\nBournemouth are a team in form right now, and that is who we welcome to Stamford Bridge tonight for the 7.30pm kick off. Interestingly, there are a couple of Bournemouth centre backs on our transfer shortlist, so all eyes will be on them as well tonight.\nAnd speaking of centre backs, I put out an exclusive report yesterday on Chelsea's plans to bring in a new one this month, which they are actively looking to do. There was an internal meeting on Sunday, and you can get the details on that in here.\nI also had two other sourced articles out yesterday, with a lot simmering up now. The Renato Veiga situation was the story of the weekend really and came out of nowhere. The player is unhappy and wants to leave already after only joining us in the summer. So what is the situation there? Get all the inside info explained here.\nMy other sourced article is on Frank Lampard at Coventry. As we reported recently, super Frank wants to bring in a Chelsea player on loan this month, and he has asked about four players specifically. Find out who those players are and how Chelsea have responded to those enquiries in here.\nFollowing on from the Veiga news really, I have an opinion article on the situation and the downside of having such a big squad and being able to field two different starting lineups for league and cup games. There are many positives, but the negatives are starting to appear now too. More on that in here.",
