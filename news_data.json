        "excerpt": "Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos joined Samsung in a $700 million bet on Tenstorrent, valuing the AI chip startup with ambitions of taking on Nvidia Corp. at about $2.6 billion.",
        "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos joined Samsung in a $700 million bet on Tenstorrent, valuing the AI chip startup with ambitions of taking on Nvidia Corp. at about $2.6 billion.\nTenstorrent, which hopes to create a chip to try and break Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI business, raised capital in a funding round led by South Korea's AFW Partners and Samsung Securities, founder and semiconductor pioneer Jim Keller said in an interview. Bezos Expeditions joined LG Electronics Inc. and Fidelity in that financing, betting on Keller's pedigree and the booming opportunity in artificial intelligence tech.\nThe money will be used to build out Tenstorrent's engineering team, invest in its global supply chain and build large artificial intelligence training servers to help demonstrate its technology.\nAs the quest for more power and cost efficiency in AI ramps up, smaller companies are sprouting up trying to snatch market share from Nvidia's power-hungry chips. Tenstorrent, an Nvidia neighbor in Santa Clara, California, is one of many now engineering solutions aimed at delivering a more affordable path to AI development. That's built on open-source and commonplace technology, avoiding complex and pricey components like the high-bandwidth memory Nvidia favors.\n'You can't beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,' Keller said. 'But they'll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.'\nNvidia offers developers a full suite of proprietary technology, covering everything from the chips to the interconnects and even data center layouts, with the promise of all parts working better because they were designed in concert. Companies like rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Tenstorrent are instead aiming for greater interoperability with other technology providers, whether through shared industry standards or opening their designs for others to use.\nTenstorrent is also a proponent of an alternative kind of logic processor based on an open standard called RISC-V, which poses a challenge to Arm Holdings Plc. Keller, known for his silicon design work at Apple Inc., Tesla Inc. and AMD, is an advocate.\n'In the past, I worked with proprietary tech and it was really tough,' Keller said. 'Open source helps you build a bigger platform. It attracts engineers. And yes, it's a little bit of a passion project.'\nMuch like RISC-V and Japanese partner Rapidus Corp., Tenstorrent still has a lot to prove. To date, the nascent company has signed contracts with customers totaling nearly $150 million, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's tens of billions of dollars of datacenter revenue each quarter.\nTenstorrent plans to release a new AI processor at a cadence of every two years, Keller said. Nvidia, on the other hand, intends to refresh its AI chip offerings on an annual cycle, its boss Jensen Huang said in June.\nAFW Partners invested after hearing positive feedback from Korean companies already collaborating with Tenstorrent, such as LG, said managing director Bonil Koo.\nTenstorrent's first chips were made by GlobalFoundries Inc., and the next iterations will come from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., the company said. It's begun designing for cutting-edge 2-nanometer fabrication as well. TSMC and Samsung will commence their mass production at that scale next year, and Tenstorrent is in discussions with them and Japan's Rapidus, which aims for 2nm output in 2027.\nOther investors in this funding round include Export Development Canada, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Hyundai Motor Group and Baillie Gifford.\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.'s founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang agreed to open an artificial intelligence research and development center in Vietnam as the company steps up its presence in Southeast Asia.\nThe project, along with a Viettel Group data center that uses Nvidia technology, will help develop advanced AI in the country, Vietnam's Investment Minister Nguyen Chi Dung said at a signing ceremony in Hanoi on Thursday. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh was also in attendance.\n'Nvidia will advance Vietnam's AI by building AI infrastructure, growing the number of AI experts in Vietnam and supporting AI startups,' Huang said at a briefing with Dung.\nNvidia will also acquire Vingroup JSC's AI unit VinBrain, which is 'the starting point of a major future design center,' Huang said. VinBrain is a startup whose focus includes applying AI to the medical field, according to its website. Huang did not give a valuation for the VinBrain acquisition. Vingroup representatives were not immediately available for comment outside normal business hours.\n'Today is the birthday of Nvidia Vietnam.' Huang added.\nBefore coming to Hanoi, Huang met with Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday and agreed to strengthen cooperation with the country, including help in developing the country's AI infrastructure.\nThe Nvidia chief executive officer's regional tour comes as Southeast Asian countries compete for big tech investments to become data center and AI hubs. Damac Group, backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, plans to invest about $3 billion to build data centers in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand over the next three to five years.\n'Nvidia's support in the AI field will help Vietnam not only achieve its development goals in high-tech industry in general and AI ​​field in particular, but also contribute to boosting the entire Southeast Asia region to become a destination of innovation,' Dung said.\nLast year, Huang told Chinh that Nvidia was eyeing a semiconductor center in Vietnam after investing about $250 million in the nation. In April, the Vietnamese government said Nvidia was reviewing three Vietnam cities — Ho Chi Minh City, Danang and Hanoi — for an AI center.\nVietnam is targeting annual revenue of more than $100 billion from the semiconductor industry by 2050. The government aims to set up three big data centers and three AI centers by 2030, according to a national strategy released in 2021.\n'A country's data should be considered its natural and national resource,' Huang said. 'Vietnam should process your own data and transform it into Vietnam AI for your industry and society.'\n--With assistance from Linh Vu Nguyen.\n(Updates with VinBrain details and extra quotes.)\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",
